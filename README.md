# Project Planner

**<u>Synopsis</u>**

For this project I will use Python's tuples, sets, and graphical modules to create a planner for developing a small gaming app.

**<u>How it works</u>**

This planner will create a schedule to help users plan their work. The program will display a window with a button that a user can press to choose a project file. It will then read a list of tasks from the file and sort them in the order of their starting time based on certain prerequisites. The resulting data data will be converted into a chart tha will display when each task starts and ends.
